## Deployment Instructions

### Backend (Express/Node)
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Deploy to [Render](https://render.com/) (or Railway/Heroku):
   - Create a new Web Service.
   - Set the root directory to `server`.
   - Set environment variables (`MONGODB_URI`, `PORT`).
   - Use `npm install` as the build command and `node server.js` as the start command.
3. After deployment, note your backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.onrender.com`).

### Frontend (React)
1. Update `client/.env`:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
   ```
2. Push changes to GitHub.
3. Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com/):
   - Connect your repo and select the `client` folder as the root.
   - Set environment variables as needed.
   - Use `npm run build` as the build command.
4. After deployment, note your frontend URL (e.g., `https://your-frontend.vercel.app`).
